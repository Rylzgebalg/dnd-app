# dnd-app
This app includes helpful tools for anyone playing tabletop role-playing games, designed with DnD 5th Edition in mind. It is meant to be used alongside a character sheet, not as a replacement. 


## Installation
<ul><li>Download the app-debug.apk to your android device and run it via your file manager</li></ul>
OR
<ul><li>Use the application in your browser on any device on my <a href="https://rylzgebalg.github.io/www/index.html">github.io</a></li></ul>


## Motivation
My two main motivations for this project are enhancing the player experience and practicing HTML/CSS/JS. This project started in early 2019 after taking a basic HTML/CSS/JS class in university. When starting DnD, I quickly noticed that there are things I would rather let a computer do or do digitally, like tracking resources or extracting data from a table. Since then, I have been updating this app to suit my needs. This project is far from finished.


## Features
This app consists of multiple small tools which are accessed by a navigation bar at the top of the screen. These tools are:
<ul>
  <li>Character Profile: Tracks which character you are currently using and adapts other tools to this profile. Currently only works with dice roller/presets.</li>
  <li>Dice Roller/Presets: Rolls how many dice of any kind you want. Dice Presets are like setting aside a set of dices and rolling them at the press of a button.</li>
  <li>Wild Magic Surge: Press the button to get an entry from the sorcerer's wild magic table instead of searching it yourself.</li>
  <li>Spellslot Tracker: Track how many and which spell slots you have used. The tracker adapts to your level and class.</li>
  <li>Item Bag: Track how many resources you have. Create multiple bags and use the select menu to change between them. </li>
  <li>Food Tracker: Tracks food for your group.</li>
  <li>Creature Manager: Let multiple creatures of the same kind act fast and efficient.  </li>
</ul>
